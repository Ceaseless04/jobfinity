The objective is to implement a strategic technical solution to support the governance and monitoring of break standards - including enhancements to audit capabilities. As a part of this program, the required remediation of source system data feeds involves consolidation of data into standardized feeds.

These remediated data feeds will be consumed by ETL layer. The reconciliation tool is
designed to source data from an ETL layer. The data from the Front and Back office systems,
together with static data must therefore be delivered to ETL. Here it will be pre-processed and delivered to reconciliation tool before the reconciliation process can be performed.
